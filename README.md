 About: 
 Disoriented is a project that challenges the traditional VR paradigms. The project features a farm setting but with flying cows and trees of various sizes to create absurdity.
 In this project, the user with VR goggles will have no control over the changes within the scene, while users connecting from a laptop can modify the scene. Possible roles and the changes they can make respectively:
 1. view-only (no control)
 2. tree-control (location of trees by dragging)
 3. gui-control (control gui panel, such as cow dropping)

TBD:
1. cow-control
2. optimize data transmission
3. deployment
